# LeaderBoardProject
This project is a ReactJS-based leaderboard that displays the top 10 player scores with a responsive design. It features an "Add Score" popup allowing users to input a username and score, which is then dynamically added to the list with smooth animations. The leaderboard includes a scrolling footer for an enhanced user experience.
